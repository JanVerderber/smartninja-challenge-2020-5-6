                        In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift,
                        is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter
                        in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3,
                        D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
                        The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and
                        still has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and
                        in modern practice offers essentially no communications security.
